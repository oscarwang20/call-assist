## Project Description
Have you ever had to wait on hold during a phone call? This is one example of the inconvenience of phone calls. Our team proposes the development of an app improving upon the built-in phone service to bring the ease of convenience present in modern day applications to the outdated system of phone calls. This can be done through introducing automation, speech-to-text conversions, and presenting conversations in more accessible forms such as a chat interface. You may say that this service already exists in the form of virtual helpers or chat services, such as Verizonâ€™s chat bots. However, small businesses, casual phone calls, etc. do not have this available to them. Our service aims to be applicable to all phone calls, because it will be client-side.
